## EcoFresh Produce Inc. - A Vision of Quality and Sustainability
Founded in the lush, fertile valleys of the Pacific Northwest, EcoFresh Produce Inc. has always prided itself on delivering the freshest, highest-quality fruits and vegetables to its discerning customers. With a commitment to sustainability and eco-friendly practices, EcoFresh has grown from a modest family farm into a leading supplier for both local groceries and international distributors.

At the heart of EcoFresh's success is a promise to its customers: every apple, orange, carrot, and leaf of lettuce is grown using organic methods, harvested at the peak of ripeness, and delivered with care to ensure unmatched flavor and nutrition.

## The Challenge Arises
However, in recent months, an unsettling trend has emerged. A small but growing number of customers have reported issues with the quality of EcoFresh's produce - complaints of wilted greens, bruised fruits, and vegetables that spoil faster than expected. These reports are troubling, not just for the potential impact on EcoFresh's reputation, but because they hint at underlying problems within the supply chain that could compromise the company's core values of quality and sustainability.

Preliminary investigations suggest that the issues are not with the farming practices themselves but rather with how the produce is handled once it leaves the farm. Whether due to delays in transport, improper storage conditions, or inefficiencies at distribution centers, it's clear that EcoFresh needs a better way to monitor its products through every step of the supply chain.

## The Mission
To address this challenge, EcoFresh is launching an ambitious new initiative: a comprehensive tracking system that will follow every item from the field to the store shelf. This system will not only ensure the integrity and quality of EcoFresh produce but also bolster consumer trust by offering unprecedented transparency into the journey of their food.

## Your Role
As a talented software developer with a passion for problem-solving and a flair for innovation, you've been tasked with designing and implementing the prototype of this tracking system. Your solution will need to capture detailed information at each stage of the supply chain, from harvest to sale, and present it in a user-friendly format that can be accessed by EcoFresh employees, partners, and even customers.

Your work on this project has the potential to transform EcoFresh's operations, enhancing its reputation for quality and transparency, and setting a new standard for the entire industry. The stakes are high, but so is the opportunity to make a real difference.

## The Challenge

For each product in our supply chain, we seek comprehensive traceability to enhance quality control and customer satisfaction. Specifically, we aim to gather and monitor the following critical data points:

1. Harvesting Details:
    * Date of Harvest: Precisely when was the product harvested?
    * Location of Harvest: The exact farm or region where the product was harvested.

2. Packing Information:
    * Packing Date: The date on which the product was packed, ready for shipment.

3. Shipping Logistics:
    * Shipping Date: When the product left the facility or farm en route to its first or next destination.

4. Arrival Timestamps:
    * Arrival Date at Store or Distributor: The date and time when the product arrived at either a retail store or a distributor's warehouse.

5. Distribution Cycle:
    * If the product is sent to a distributor before reaching the store, document each segment of its journey:
    * Repeat the tracking of shipping and arrival dates for each leg of the journey, until the product reaches its final retail destination.

6. Final Sale:
    * Sale Date: When the product was purchased by the end consumer.


This detailed tracking will enable us to pinpoint any stage in the supply chain that may be affecting the quality of our products. Through this initiative, we aim to maintain the high standard of excellence our customers expect from us, ensuring that every item we sell is fresh, safe, and of the highest quality.
